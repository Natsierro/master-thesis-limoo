# Data Cleaning
The data cleaning code was also used to do data exploration about the instacart dataset. It was mostly important to calculate the different metrics in the basket analysis as a basis for the product recommendation system in the simulation. The code to do so was partly copied and inspired by the following source: https://github.com/ellmanalex/instacart_basket_analysis/blob/master/association_rule_mining.ipynb

To use this code, a few modifications, for example for the paths, might have to be done.
