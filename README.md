# Master Thesis

This github is the code and data used in Nathan Sierro's Master Thesis at E4S SMT. It can be useful for anyone wanting to replicate the results found in the thesis.

There are different folders with data and code that will be explained here.

1) Data is the folder with the raw data and its sources used to reach the conclusions in the thesis.

2) Data Cleaning is the folder with the scripts used to do data visualisation as well as cleaning the raw data into something usable in the simulation.

3) Results Data is the folder with all the different outputs from the simulation scripts.

4) Simulation is the folder with the scripts implementing the simulation as well as the scripts using the simulations results and cleaning them for analysis.

5) Analysis is the folder with all the scripts used to reach the different graphics and conclusions drawn in the thesis.
